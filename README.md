# Survival Analysis: Stomach Cancer
This project involves conducting a survival analysis of stomach cancer, using gene expression data from the TCGA database. Various survival analysis techniques were employed, including:

1) Kaplan-Meier Estimation
2) Cox Proportional Hazards
3) Random Survival Forest: identifying top predictors of stomach cancer, out of 20,000 genes.

All code was done in R and is available in the file, "tcga_survival_analysis.R"
